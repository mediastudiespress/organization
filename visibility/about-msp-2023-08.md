## About mediastudies.press

[mediastudies.press](https://www.mediastudies.press/about) is a nonprofit, scholar-led publisher of open access (OA) books, founded in 2019. The press was established with the mission to provide a more just platform for books in the media and communication discipline. We believe that custody over scholarly publishing should be restored to the academy, and operated on a nonprofit basis in the public interest. This bedrock principle informs our *diamond OA* status: Publishing with [mediastudies.press](https://mediastudies.press) is free on principle. Our aim is to demonstrate, on a small scale, an open-access publishing model supported by libraries rather than author fees. Open access for readers, we believe, should not be traded for new barriers to authorship. (See our [open access policy](https://www.mediastudies.press/oa-principles).) We are committed to bibliodiversity, scaling small, mutual aid, and the campaign to reclaim scholarly publishing and its supporting infrastructure from the oligopolists.

[mediastudies.press](https://mediastudies.press) is a [nonprofit corporation](https://github.com/mediastudiespress/organization/blob/master/operations/pa_articles_of_incorporation_2018.pdf#L0) registered in Pennsylvania, USA, with federal 501(c)(3) [tax-exempt status](https://github.com/mediastudiespress/organization/blob/master/operations/irs_letter_501c3_2018.pdf). We pride ourselves in combining a values-driven approach with professional standards.

### A. Distribution and formats

Nearly all [mediastudies.press](https://mediastudies.press) books are published in four formats: html (on [PubPub](http://pubpub.org)), PDF, ePub, and in paperback. The first three are free to download; the print versions are available print-on-demand at a fair price.

We publish living works, with iterative updates stitched into our process. And we encourage multi-modal submissions that reflect the mediated environments our authors study.

We distribute each book on seven platforms:

* [mediastudies.press](https://www.mediastudies.press) (html, PDF, ePub)

We are in discussion with [GOBI](https://www.ebsco.com/academic-libraries/products/gobi-library-solutions) for print-copy academic library distribution.

### B. Community engagement

[mediastudies.press](https://mediastudies.press) is a proud member of [ScholarLed](https://scholarled.org), the coalition of mission-oriented OA publishers; our director is currently ScholarLed chair. Both the director and associate director are on the board of [Libraria](https://libraria.cc), the OA-justice group for anthropology and adjacent disciplines. The [director](https://www.jeffpooley.com) is co-founder and co-lead of [MediArXiv](https://mediarxiv.com), the OA repository for the media studies fields. He serves on the communication field’s main society’s OA task force, and writes frequently on OA and epistemic justice issues. 

We are committed to expanding the range of voices that we publish, with Latin American scholars a particular interest for outreach. [mediastudies.press](https://mediastudies.press) publishes a journal, [*History of Media Studies*](https://hms.mediastudies.press/volume-two), whose main editorial mission is to expand the field’s historiography beyond the English-speaking North Atlantic.

Transparency is one of our core values. We have maintained a [Transparency page](https://www.mediastudies.press/transparency), with filings, reports, meeting minutes, metrics, and even financials available for review. Other documents and records are available on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/mediastudiespress), and on [msp-docs](https://msp-docs.org/docs-docs/landing).

### C. Our current series

We currently have four series: (1) [Public Domain](https://www.mediastudies.press/public-domain-series): newly-introduced and critically annotated republications of public-domain books that promise contemporary relevance; (2) [Media Manifold](https://www.mediastudies.press/media-manifold-series): original monographs and other book-length works of contemporary media scholarship; (3) [Open Reader](https://www.mediastudies.press/open-reader-series): media themed open readers, collections of works available on the open web, selected and ordered with university courses in mind; and (4) [History of Media Studies](https://www.mediastudies.press/history-of-media-studies): monographs and other scholarly works centered on the history of media, communication, and film studies.

### D. Metadata

We are careful custodians of metadata, in line with the highest professional standards. We use the open source [Thoth](https://thoth.pub) software to maintain per-format ISBNs, DOIs, OCLC and Library of Congress identifiers, subject classifications, author affiliation (ROR), author ORCIDs, and chapter-level DOIs and licensure. See our [catalogue](https://openbookcollective.org/books/?initiative=10) on the Open Book Collective.

### E. Metrics & privacy

We adhere to the [privacy policy](https://www.pubpub.org/legal/privacy) of [Knowledge Futures](https://www.knowledgefutures.org), the nonprofit that hosts [PubPub](https://www.pubpub.org), our html publishing platform. 

As a service to authors, we provide monthly updates on downloads and sales, with a dedicated page for each book. See an [example](https://msp-docs.org/author-pages/Communication+Conduct+in+an+Island+Community). 

### F. Governance

[mediastudies.press](https://mediastudies.press) is structured by its [Articles of Incorporation](https://github.com/mediastudiespress/organization/blob/master/operations/pa_articles_of_incorporation_2018.pdf#L0) and [Bylaws](https://github.com/mediastudiespress/organization/blob/master/operations/bylaws.md). We are governed by an international [Board of Directors](https://www.mediastudies.press/transparency), who appoint an executive director and other staff. The press also maintains an [Advisory Board](https://www.mediastudies.press/team) of scholarly publishing and/or media studies expertise.

### G. Memberships

[mediastudies.press](https://mediastudies.press) is a member of the [Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association](https://oaspa.org/member/mediastudies-press) (OASPA), [ScholarLed](https://scholarled.org/), [Knowledge Futures](https://www.knowledgefutures.org/membership), and the [Radical Open Access collective](http://radicaloa.disruptivemedia.org.uk/directory/mediastudies-press/), with vetted affiliations including the [Directory of Open Access Books](https://directory.doabooks.org/browse?type=publisher&value=mediastudies.press) (DOAB), [Project MUSE](https://muse.jhu.edu/search?action=browse&limit=publisher_id:351&min=1&max=10&t=publisher_facet_select),
[OAPEN](https://library.oapen.org/handle/20.500.12657/43308), [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/), and the [Open Book Collective](https://openbookcollective.org/packages/11/info/).

### H. OA licenses

All of our books are published open access, with author retention of copyright. Our default option for authors is [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), with authors permitted to select another Creative Commons license upon consultation with the press. We fully comply with cOAlition S’s [Rights Retention Strategy](https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy/). See our [open access policies](https://www.mediastudies.press/oa-principles), adapted from Jean-Sébastien Caux’s [Genuine Open Access Principles](https://jscaux.org/blog/post/2018/05/05/genuine-open-access/). Our commitments include transparent nonprofit governance, the use of open infrastructure wherever possible, transparent finances, author copyright, open licensing and citations, and a no-APC policy. See also our [standard contract](https://github.com/mediastudiespress/organization/blob/master/operations/contracts_and_memberships/standard-author-contract-2021.md#L0).

### I. Peer review

All [mediastudies.press](https://mediastudies.press) manuscripts undergo peer review: double-anonymous by default with at least two subject experts, as well as more open modes at authors’ discretion. Manuscripts are first reviewed by both the director and the associate director, and by series editors when appropriate, to assess scholarly quality and suitability for the press. Authors that pass this first round of review are consulted about their peer review preferences. In addition to the double-anonymous review default, authors may select signed/open or community review. The review type is indicated in the published book’s front matter. See our [peer review page](https://www.mediastudies.press/peer-review). 

### J. Publicity

As a scholar-run operation, our publicity outreach is uncommonly informed by the fields’ intellectual contours. We promote our books, for example, across appropriate listservs and on social media. For each title we organize and host a free online webinar, hosted on Zoom with the author and three to four experts engaged in a moderated discussion, as an official launch event. More broadly, we prioritize discoverability through careful metadata, library records, and directory listings. 


### K. Preservation

At [mediastudies.press](https://www.mediastudies.press/), we publish works in a variety of media formats, and also encourage versioning. As a result, version-of-record, text-based preservation options like [Portico](https://www.portico.org/) and [CLOCKSS](https://clockss.org/) are imperfectly suited to our needs. Our preservation strategy has two components: (1) Multi-platform distribution: In addition to our [PubPub](https://www.pubpub.org/)-based main site, we are distributing our PDFs through [Project MUSE](https://muse.jhu.edu/), [OAPEN](https://www.oapen.org/), the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/), and [MediArXiv](https://mediarxiv.org/). The driving principle is redundancy and resilience. Our agreement with Project MUSE includes [Portico](https://www.portico.org/)hosting for our PDF titles. (2) We recognize that long-term preservation requires robust, multi-modal archiving infrastructure. We are closely following the ongoing discussions hosted by [COPIM](https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/archiving-and-preservation-workshop-sept-2020/release/1), [Portico, CLOCKSS, and NYU Press](https://www.dpconline.org/blog/enhancing-services-to-preserve-new-forms-of-scholarship), and [Duke University Libraries](https://expansive.pubpub.org/pub/snb2tqyr/release/1).

### L. Finances

The existing business model of [mediastudies.press](https://mediastudies.press) is driven by collective funding memberships (OBC and OACIP), financial donations and the donated labor of the director and associate director, supplemented by book sales and institutional or other funds provided by authors. However, on principle, we do not charge BPCs, and instead merely ask authors of accepted manuscripts to check for existing funds. Recent and detailed financial reports are [available online](https://msp-docs.org/finances/finances), as part of our commitment to transparency.We are in our first year of offering collective-funding support through the [Open Book Collective](https://openbookcollective.org/view/package/11/summary/). Our goal is for the OBC to cover 60 percent of our production costs, for up to 5 books.

### M. First copy costs

Our cost per book is difficult to estimate. We expect that number to stabilize around $5,000 per book. Currently direct costs are primarily copy-editing, ranging from $1,000 to $2,000 per book, with cover design costing between $100 to $500. The per title Project MUSE fee is $100, and reviewers’ honoraria incur another $200 dollars (or $300 with a second-round). The other steps in the process are run on a volunteer basis: ingestion, editing, peer review management, typesetting, distribution and marketing. We have overhead that is difficult to translate into per-book terms: software (e.g., Adobe CC, Airtable) and memberships (e.g., OASPA, Knowledge Futures) as the main expenses. Our aspiration is to provide compensation for facets of the operation that are now provided on a volunteer basis (except editorial roles), with the expectation that our per-title costs will rise to $4,500 to $5,500, [in line with other scholar-led presses](https://punctumbooks.pubpub.org/pub/scholar-led-open-access-publishers-are-not-author-chutes/release/1).
