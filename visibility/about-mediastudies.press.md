# about-mediastudies.press

mediastudies.press is a new, open access publisher for the media and communication studies fields. Launched in 2019, the press is **non-profit** and **scholar-led**. We publish living works, with iterative updates stitched into our process. And we encourage **multi-modal** submissions that reflect the mediated environments our authors study. 

Publishing with mediastudies.press is free on principle. Our aim is to demonstrate, on a small scale, an open access publishing model supported by libraries rather than author fees. Open access to for readers, we believe, should not be traded for new barriers to authorship. 

mediastudies.press publishes **singles**—standalone works like monographs—as well as **serials**. All of our published works are rigorously **peer-reviewed**, and receive unusual editorial attention. We prioritize **discoverability** through careful metadata, library records, and directory listings. As a scholar-run operation, our publicity outreach is uncommonly informed by the fields’ intellectual contours. 

If these values and commitments match your own, please consider publishing with us. The first step us to [reach out](/submit).
