Publisher will work with Authors to provide leads, though Authors agree to take primary responsibility for the attempt to secure funding.

### Section 12. Limitation of Liability

### Section 13. Term and Termination

1. *Term.* This Agreement begins on the Effective Date and continues until the earlier of expiration of the copyright, or termination as set forth in this Agreement.
2. *Termination*. Publisher may terminate this Agreement for cause, including if the Authors do not meet delivery dates identified in Section 5 and a new schedule is not agreed upon, or if the required permissions are not received. Either party my terminate this Agreement in the case of another event that materially affects Authors’ ability to complete the Work or Publisher’s ability to publish the Work, or in the event of a default under the terms of this Agreement that is not cured within 30 days after written notice to the other party specifying such breach.

This Agreement is personal and may not be assigned by Authors without the prior, written permission of Publisher. If any term is found invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be enforced to the fullest extent that it is valid and enforceable under applicable law in a manner consistent with the intent of the parties expressed in that section; all other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Any waiver of any provision of this Agreement must be in writing and signed by the party to be bound.
