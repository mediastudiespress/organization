#### The model of https://www.mediastudies.press/peer-review is fully described on your website with great transparency, but for OASPA external peer review is essential. What percentage of external reviews do you typically use for the book content?

One hundred percent of book content that is not previously published (e.g., public domain work) is and will be externally peer reviewed. 

#### We are excited by your application, but since there are only 3 books available for now, can you tell us what books are in the pipeline for publication in the near future?

Yes! For 2021, we have five books slated for publication. We are continuing our deliberate strategy of a slow increase in scale, with a predominant focus on the Public Domain series:

* *Creativity: Process and Personality: Six Case-Studies of Eminent Psychologists* (Public Domain series) - 1964 unpublished thesis, with a new introduction by the author
* *Cold War Communication Research: The MIT Research Program in International Communications, 1948–1953* (History of Media Studies series) - original monograph, published alongside archival documents 
* *Culture for the Millions: Mass Media in Modern Society* (Public Domain series) - out-of-print 1961 collection, with a new introduction
* *Social Media and the Self* (Open Reader series) - a course-oriented open collection of public domain and openly licensed works, together with outbound links

For 2022, we currently have three titles planned:

* *Communication Conduct in an Island Community* (Public Domain series) - Erving Goffman's dissertation, with a new introduction by Yves Winkin, on Goffman's centenary
* *Frank Ford Collection* (Public Domain series) - a collection of unpublished and obscurely published works by Franklin Ford, edited and with a new introduction by Dominique Trudel and Juliette De Maeyer
* *Data & Society* (Open Reader series) - a second course-oriented open reader.

For 2023, we currently have two titles planned:

* *Communication and Sociology, 1880–1925* (Public Domain series)
* *Communication and Psychology, 1880-1925* (Public Domain series)

#### You are currently largely self-funded and hope to attract grant funding: are there any plans of introducing fees to authors in future financing at all? Do you have any institutional support or ongoing discussions you could share with us?

* We have no plans to accept author fees, as a guiding principle of our founding values and [open access principles](https://www.mediastudies.press/oa-principles). We are, instead, devoting 2021 to building a collective funding model, to be launched in early 2022. We are seeking grant support to help support the launch, with the plan for full sustainability by 2023. We are building our approach with the [COPIM](https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/wp3-report-revenue-models-for-oa-monographs-2020/release/2) and [MIT/Arcadia](https://direct.mit.edu/books/pages/Open_Access) no-BPC reports/frameworks as  potential blueprints, together with the existing and successful membership experiments of [punctum books](https://punctumbooks.com/supporting-library-membership-program/) and [Open Book Publishers](https://www.openbookpublishers.com/section/44/1) as guides. 
* We have enough donor funding to operate without any external funds through 2021. 
* We are currently debating the question of accepting contributions from already-funded authors whose funding is eligible for publication costs.
* We have held preliminary discussions with [TOME](https://www.openmonographs.org) (about a potential expansion beyond university presses to scholar-led presses) and with [MIT Press](https://direct.mit.edu/books/pages/Open_Access) (about serving as an example non-university press, born-OA house to test their soon-to-be-released general model).
* We have had preliminary discussions with the [Annenberg School for Communication Library](https://www.library.upenn.edu/annenberg) at the University of Pennsylvania about a more robust partnership, along the lines of the [UCSB arrangement with punctum books](https://www.library.ucsb.edu/punctum-books-ucsb-library-partnership). 

#### Finally, we are happy to consider your application as a book publisher for now, but do please let us know what happens when the journal is set up, and do please consider our above criteria (fully OA; mandatory DOAJ membership and CC BY licence; external peer review, etc.) when you finalise the launch, so that we can then add your journal to the membership if successful.

* Thank you! We have expanded our [Editorial Board](https://hms.mediastudies.press/editorial), whose themed essays will launch the journal in September. Regular submissions will be externally peer reviewed, and all other DOAJ criteria will be met as we prepare our application. (Note that mediastudies.press defaults to a CC BY-NC license, with CC BY available by author preference.) We will notify OASPA so that the journal-publishing criteria can be checked when appropriate.
