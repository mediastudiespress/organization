# Model Types

*Draft 2021-04*

The three major options, which may perhaps be combined, are:

1. **Library partnership:** The idea is to affiliate in a substantial way with a single library, like the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School. An example would be [punctum book's partnership with UCSB's library](https://www.library.ucsb.edu/punctum-books-ucsb-library-partnership).

2. **mediastudies.press-specific library membership program:** Here the idea is to encourage libraries with substantial media and communication programs in their host institutions to pay an annual subsidy, on a tiered basis linked to institution size and (perhaps) other factors like host nation GDP per capita or library budget size. An example would be [Open Library of Humanities' Library Partnership Subsidy model](https://www.openlibhums.org/site/about/the-olh-model/).

3. **A discipline-specific funding exchange:** This is the idea I floated in a [threadbare proposal](https://github.com/mediastudiespress/organization/blob/master/operations/funding_models/born-oa-funding-exchange-model.md): Organizing libraries (and perhaps other funders, like foundations) into a funding entity that supports applicant-publishers in the field (e.g., mediastudies.press, mediacommons, Meson Press). 

## Other Sources

* **Paperback sales:** These, so far, have been meager.
* **Donations:** The main source of funding so far, but unsustainable.
* **BPCs for authors who are already funded:** This is a decision we have to make: Do we accept BPCs if and when authors bring funding (from a grant, for example) to the project? If so, the availability of such funding would need ot be explicitly de-linked from editorial decisions and workflows.
* **Grants:** Capacity building grants, and even book-specific grants like the [NEH Open Book Program](https://www.neh.gov/grants/odh/FOBP) or the [Toward an Open Monograph Ecosystem](https://www.openmonographs.org) (which is considering spreading to scholar-led presses).
