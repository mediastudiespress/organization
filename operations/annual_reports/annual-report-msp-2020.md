# Annual Report 2020

2020 marked the real launch of [mediastudies.press](https://mediastudies.press), with the publication of the press’s first two books. This report lists significant developments over the year, followed by a brief financial overview.

## 1. First Two Books Published

mediastudies.press published its first two books, both in the [Public Domain series](https://www.mediastudies.press/public-domain-series): *[Our Master’s Voice: Advertising](https://www.mediastudies.press/masters-voice)* and *[Liberty and the News](https://www.mediastudies.press/liberty-and-the-news)*.

The books were released in five formats: **online**, **PDF**, **ePub**, **Mobi**, and **paperback**. In keeping with our mission to spread the books as far and wide as possible, the singles are hosted on six platforms: [mediastudies.press](https://www.mediastudies.press) (PubPub html) itself, as well as [Project MUSE](https://muse.jhu.edu/search?action=browse&limit=publisher_id:351) (PDF), [OAPEN](https://library.oapen.org/handle/20.500.12657/43308) (PDF), the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/@mediastudiespress) (PDF), [Google Books](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=inpublisher:%22Mediastudies.Press%22&tbm=bks&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi7s4mQh6HuAhVqGFkFHXSOCu4QmxMoADAIegQIHBAC) (ePub), and [Apple Books](https://books.apple.com/us/book/our-masters-voice/id1544852855) (ePub).

As our friends at [punctum](https://punctumbooks.pubpub.org/pub/visualization-book-usage-statistics-metabase/release/2) and [Open Book Publishers](https://blogs.openbookpublishers.com/counter-metrics-oabooks/) have documented, keeping track of readership and download tallies is a challenge at best. One goal for 2021 is to develop a humane means to report usage to authors, without over-feeding the metrics beast.

On the paperback side, we are working with the UK-based [Printondemand-worldwide](https://www.printondemand-worldwide.com). We can upload and order small batches, for our own fulfillment--or use PODWW’s wholesaling service. We are still getting a feel for the distribution and point-of-sale side, but the print-on-demand service itself has proven excellent. (Thanks to punctum’s [Dan Rudmann](https://danrudmann.com) for recommending the operation.) For direct sales from our website, we are using an indie Stripe-enabled storefront service, [Checkout Page](https://checkoutpage.co). Here’s an [example](https://checkoutpage.co/checkout/mediastudiespress/our-masters-voice-advertising).

## 2. New Affiliation: Project MUSE

We were excited to join Project Muse’s [Open Acess Book Program](https://about.muse.jhu.edu/publishers/oa-books-program/), which now hosts our first [two books](https://muse.jhu.edu/search?action=browse&limit=publisher_id:351) by PDF chapter. One major advantage is that MUSE--whose nonprofit mission resonates with ours--enables OCLC integration and inclusion in many libraries’ catalogs, along with preservation. 

## 3. New Affiliation: OAPEN and DOAB

mediastudies.press is now hosting its books on [OAPEN](https://library.oapen.org/handle/20.500.12657/43308), the respected nonprofit OA book host. We are also listing our titles on the [Directory of Open Access Books](https://www.doabooks.org) (DOAB). 

## 4. New Affiliation: Radical Open Access

We have also joined [Radical Open Access](http://radicaloa.disruptivemedia.org.uk), a horizontal consortium of like-minded OA organizations. RadicalOA also maintains a [Directory of Academic-Led Presses](http://radicaloa.disruptivemedia.org.uk/directory/), which [now lists mediastudies.press](http://radicaloa.disruptivemedia.org.uk/directory/mediastudies-press/).

## 5. Newsletter

We are launching a [quarterly newsletter](https://www.mediastudies.press/newsletter). In fact, this Annual Report, in an html version, will be the first, January 2021 edition.

## 6. Donation Portal

To simplify the donation process--since mediastudies.press currently relies on charitable donations while its library paternship model is planned--we created a [Donorbox account](https://donorbox.org/donate-to-mediastudies-press). 

## 7. Designer and Copy Editor

As our first two Public Domain books moved into production in late spring, we recruited a designer, [Mark McGillivray](https://www.markmcgillivray.com), and a copy editor, [Petra Dreiser](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petra-dreiser-31a00242/?originalSubdomain=ca). Mark designed our Public Domain cover template, while Petra proofed the books and line-edited new material. We’re excited to keep working with both of them.

## 8. New Series

We launched two new series, with the first titles for both to appear in 2021: the [Open Reader series](https://www.mediastudies.press/open-reader-series), html-only, media-themed collections of works available on the open web, selected and ordered with university courses in mind; and the [History of Media Studies series](https://www.mediastudies.press/history-of-media-studies), devoted to monographs and other original scholarly works centered on the history of media, communication, and film studies. The plan with the [latter series](https://www.mediastudies.press/history-of-media-studies) is to encourage authors to include, and link to, archival materials cited in the text. 

## 9. New Board Member

Earlier in the year, Tim Elfenbein--a wayward scholar of infrastructure and labor in publishing, based in Madison, WI--joined the [mediastudies.press Board](https://www.mediastudies.press/transparency). For this and other organizational details, see the agenda and minutes from our [January 2020](https://github.com/mediastudiespress/organization/blob/master/operations/board_meetings/agenda_and_minutes_2020-01-10.md) meeting, listed on our [Transparency page](https://www.mediastudies.press/transparency). Tim is also advising on the publishing workflow and other infrastructure matters.

## 10. New Policies

The Board approved our [Open Access Principles](https://www.mediastudies.press/oa-principles) in January. Two new policies--one on [Preservation](https://www.mediastudies.press/preservation) and the other on [Peer Review](https://www.mediastudies.press/peer-review)--will go before the Board in the month ahead. 

## 11. Finances

In keeping with our commitment to transparency, we publicly list our [expenses](https://airtable.com/shruowH9xZToBNv0C/tblE0XjrDlfADUIHq), our [income](https://airtable.com/shrCZtP7bLqsAmyFm/tblegD9A20Z71IADy?blocks=hide), and our [monthly financial picture](https://airtable.com/shruowH9xZToBNv0C/tblE0XjrDlfADUIHq). We began the year with $1,531.36, and ended 2020 with a balance of $258.37. Our expenses--mostly proofing and copy editing--totaled $4,923.06, while our income--mostly donations from the director--totaled $3,280.69.

These figures are in line with expectations. Our [2020 budget](https://github.com/mediastudiespress/organization/blob/master/operations/budgets_and_plans/2020_budget.md) expected $5,542.04 in spending, and--on that basis--a minimum of $3,651.30 in income. Since our [expenses](https://airtable.com/shruowH9xZToBNv0C/tblE0XjrDlfADUIHq) were a bit lower than expected, the donation income was also lower.

One of our key goals for 2021 is to develop a library partnership program, with a careful study of [punctum](https://punctumbooks.com/supporting-library-membership-program/), [Open Book Publishers](https://www.openbookpublishers.com/section/44/1), [Open Library of Humanities](https://www.openlibhums.org/site/about/the-olh-model/), and the work coming out of [COPIM](https://www.copim.ac.uk). Stay tuned!
