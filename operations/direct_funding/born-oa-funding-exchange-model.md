# Proposal: Born-OA funding exchange model and pilot

*draft version 2021-04*

The **Born-OA Funding Exchange model** brings (1) librarians and (2) scholarly publishers together in a structured funding relationship. The modelâ€™s purpose is to provide a collective and sustainable business model for born-OA publishers, while also reducing the logistical burden on library funders. Unlike existing consortial approaches based on single-publisher membership programs, the funding exchange model is predicated on multiple funders and multiple publishers, organized along disciplinary lines. Its main features are:

- A consortium, governed by subject-specific librarians and other funders, that solicits institutional pledges and disburses funds to successful applicant-publishers
- Suggested commitments from libraries and other funders, based on a small percentage of existing serials and acquisition spending
- Organized as a nonprofit membership entity governed by library and other funders who have made funding commitments, with voting apportioned by a muted contribution weighting
- Advised by an appointed committee of domain experts, normally academics
- An operation that cycles through successive windows: (1) a funder-commitment phase, (2) an application-and-review phase, (3) a disbursement phase, and (4) an evaluation phase
- Eligible publisher-applicants that are (1) nonprofit, (2) subject-appropriate, (3) APC/BPC-free, and (4) born OA
- With two- to three-year awards based on applications and interviews of publisher-applicants, who must report on their activity during and at the conclusion of their funding window

The born-OA funding exchange model addresses two limitations of existing consortial approaches:

- Many consortial models, notably subscribe-to-open, target existing tolled publishers who, in many cases, leverage back-catalog access and existing subscription and/or acquisition spending. Born-OA publishers are generally not eligible or appropriate for these models.
- Single-publisher born-OA library partnership programs, like those of Open Library of Humanities or punctum books, present scaling problems for librarian-funders as one-off requests for support mount.

The model aims to build on existing organizational realities and domain expertise:

- Many academic libraries retain subject-specific specialists who direct subscription and acquisitions in their disciplinary domain. Some universities, likewise, maintain subject-specific libraries.
- Academic expertise, of course, is also organized along disciplinary lines.

As a result, at least initially, born-OA funding exchanges will overlay field-specific scholarship and librarianship communities.

Funding exchanges are especially important for OA publishing in social-science-and-humanities (SSH) disciplines, in which far fewer scholars retain APC funding.
