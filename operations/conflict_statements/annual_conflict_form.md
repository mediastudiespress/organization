# CONFLICT CERTIFICATION FOR MEDIASTUDIES.PRESS

## Board and Senior Staff
 
I have read and agree to abide by mediastudies.press’s conflict of interest policy (Bylaws, [Article VIII: Conflict of Interest and Compensation](https://github.com/mediastudiespress/organization/blob/master/operations/bylaws.md#article-viii-conflict-of-interest-and-compensation)). To the best of my knowledge, I have no conflicts as described in this policy.
