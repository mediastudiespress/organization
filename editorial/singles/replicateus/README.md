# Replicate Us

Markdown text of the Replicate Us blog of mediastudies.press, to be assembled and rewritten into an open-access Manifold guide to scholar-led publishing

## Rationale

A suite of open-source digital publishing tools, together with the open-access movement, have made possible a new type of scholarly publisher: run by academics, digital-first, multi-modal, and nonprofit. Replicate Us is a project to document the process of creating one such publisher, [mediastudies.press](http://mediastudies.press)—with the aim to make creating a similar, field-specific press easier.

This Github project is intended to provide a more accessible (and forkable) version of the blog contents to the community, as well as enable a trackable way for community members to submit issues in the form of corrections, suggestions, and requests. 

The project is likely to evolve into a [Manifold](http://manifoldapp.org)-based guide, in which case a more robust model of community contributions will be adopted.
